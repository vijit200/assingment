String- String is one of the most famous data type in python it is always enclosed within single or double quotes .The value in string in quote have index number.String is collection of character.A single alphabet is also act as string if we take integer in quote they will also act as string.In string only multiplication of string and addition is allowed.String are immutable.\n",
